# Instructions  

  Create a mosaic with different colors by adding class attributes and selecting individual elements.

**Mild**
Add class attributes to each div on lines 9-15.
Select the classes in CSS and give them a background-color using a hex color value.

**Medium**
Add more divs in the HTML to add a pattern on the page.

**Spicy**
Try using a gradient background.

**Extension:**
Add images of famous or notable art pieces that can be viewed at the museum.
  Use [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) to format your instructions.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```
